<center><h2>The Pool Commander</h2></center>
<blockquote>
The <em>Pool Commander</em> is a dCache specific module allowing to send commands to 
multiple pools simultaniously. It collects the output of all selected pools
and makes it available for inspection. It groups pools according to 
the dCache PoolManager <em>Pool Groups</em> and <em>Links</em>. In addition 
it provides a locally customizable selection.
   <h3>Pool Commander startup</h3>
   <blockquote>
       When the <em>Pool Commander Module</em> starts up, which is essentially after
       the application is logged into the corresponding dCache instance, the Commander
       tries to fetch the <em>Group and Link</em> lists from the <em>dCache PoolManager</em>.
       While this operation is in progress, a bar at the bottom of the display shows its
       progress. Because the gui has to fetch the groups <strong>and</strong> links,
       the progess bar is running twice before the display becomes enabled. 
       Depending on the complexity of the PoolManager configuration and the speed
       of the network connection this process may take awhile.
   </blockquote>
   <h3>The Panel Layout and Pool communication</h3>
   <blockquote>
      The main <em>Pool Commander Panel</em> is split into two parts. The left
      one offers a list of Pool Sets. Those sets can either be <em>PoolManager</em>
      <em>Links</em> or <em>Pool Groups</em>. The <em>Toggle Source</em> button just below
      the list allows to switch between both views.
      Having selected one of those Pool Sets, the right part of the main panel
      presents all pools belonging to that set, in form of a table. The table has three
      columns. The <em>Pool Name</em>, the <em>time</em> the pool needs to answer
      a command and the actual <em>Output string</em> of the corresponding pool.
      Just below the pool list table a text field allows to type a command which,
      after pressing <em>Return</em>, is sent to all pools in the table. After that,
      the table is populated with the reply of the pools. Because the reply string might
      be longer than the column table space, double clicking on a row
      opens a new text window, containing the complete text, returned by the selected pool.
      <blockquote>
      <font color=gray>
        Usually the width of the three columns are equally spaced, which might not be
        very useful. The columns can be re-adjusted to the specific needs by
        grabbing the small bar between the column titles and moving them
        right or left as needed.
      </font>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      There are three special cases of pool replies which result in different colors
      of the corresponding rows
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CommandSyntaxException</strong> indicating that the issued command
                wasn't understood by the pool.
        <li><strong>NoRouteToCellException</strong> indicating that the corresponding
                pool is not up.
        <li><strong>Request Timed Out</strong> either indicates that the corresponding
                pool appears dead or is so busy that the timeout has expired.
                See chapter <em>Special Topics -> Command Timeouts</em> on how to
                change the default timeout value.
                
      </ul> 
   </blockquote>
   <h3>Private Pool Selections</h3>
   <blockquote>
   In addition to the <em>PoolGroup</em> and <em>Link</em> selection, based on the
   PoolManager setup, a temporary selection can created.
   <p>
   Select  one or more rows from the left side pool list.
   <ul>
   <li><strong>Single selection</strong> Just click on the pool row you want to select.
   <li><strong>Multiple continues selections</strong> Click on the top row you want to have
    in your selection. Press Shift and keep it pressed while klicking on the
    bottom row of the pools you want to select. All rows between the top and botton row
    are selected.
   <li><strong>Multiple discontinues selections</strong> Pressing the control key while
      clicking on rows adds those rows to your selection. Clicking on a already selected
      rows unselects it again.
   </ul>
   After having all pools (resp. rows) you need selected from the current table, press the
   <em>popup mouse button (leftmost)</em> and select <em>Add selected items to your private
    selection</em>. After that your private selection has been populated by the selected
    pools. Switch to your private selection by pressing the <em>To Your Selection</em>
    button on the right bottom of the panel. Within the <em>private selection</em> table
    a similiar popup menu allows to remove selected items from the private selection.
    You may switch back and forth between the private and the PoolManager selections and
    perform commands independently.
