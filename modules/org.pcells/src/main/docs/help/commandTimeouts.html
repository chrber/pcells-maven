<h3>Why timeouts</h3
   <blockquote>
   Whenever a GUI application is connected to a cell/domain
   system, a proxy within the domain server is created, translating
   the issued requests into cell/domain messages. For various reasons,
   it may happen that one of the cells, the proxy is talking to,
   doesn't respond in time. If this happens, the proxy sends a 
   <em>Timeout Message</em> to the GUI, so that the GUI may release
   allocated resources and unblocks graphical components.
   The timeout, the proxy is using, is global to all requests coming
   from the connected GUI but may be different between different 
   GUI instances. From the GUI perspective the timeout can be different
   for all connected dCache instances. The default timeout is set to
   10 seconds.
   </blockquote>
<h3>How to set timeouts</h3
   <blockquote>
   There is currently no graphical component available to change
   the default timeout. In order to do so anyway, one needs to use the 
   <em>XCommander Module</em> to talk directly to the GUI proxy service.
   <p>
   <ul>
     <li>Change to the <em>Commander</em> panel</li>
     <li>Clear the <em>Cell Name</em> text field and type return within this text field.
     <li>Type <strong>set timeout &lt;newTimeoutInSeconds&gt;</strong> in the
         command text field followed by a return.
     <li>Done
   </ul>
   After that, all requests to the corresponding cell/domain system will have this timeout set.
   Larger timeouts can be quite usefull if the system has a lot of components (pools, doors) or
   is extremly busy.
   Changing the timeout is not persistent. With the next loggin into the same 
   cell/domain system the default timeout value is active again.
