<h1>The XCommander plug-in Module</h1>
<blockquote>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <blockquote>
      The XCommander plug-in module is not specific to any cell application, like the dCache.
      It's designed to simplify navigation and communication with cells. It allows to scan the 
      whole cell/domain system and provides the content, which are the cells,
      in either a table or a tree view.
      It handles history buffers for commands and cell destinations.
   </blockquote> 
   <h2>Cell system scan</h2>
   <blockquote>
      The initial screen of the XCommander module presents a dark background with
      some bubbles without any obvious meaning. Using the right mouse button
      initiates a scan of the connected cell system. Clicking the leftmost mouse button
      immediatly swithes to the actual commander panel. From the <em>commander  panel</em>
      view, a domain scan can be performed by pressing the <em>Scan Domain</em> button.
      <blockquote>
         <font color="gray">
         How is this scan done : First, the GUI checks whether a Topology manager is running
         somewhere in the cell system or not. If yes, it queries the Topology manager for
         the overall cell/domain topology.
         If no Topology manager was found, the XCommander starts its own topology detection
         algorithm which may take awhile to finish. 
         So, depending on the cell system setup (Topology manager
         running or not) the Cell System Scan may take just some seconds up to a  minute or two.
         </font>
      </blockquote>
      As soon as the cell system topology is known, it's displayed in a star like structure.
      Each domain is represented as a square, labeled by its name. Domains having TCP connections
      are connected by a line in the picture. The domain with 
      the maximum number of connections is located in the center of the image.
      The resulting  picture looks nice but is extremly useless. <br>
      Clicking the leftmost mouse button will switch to the actual commander window.
      At any time, the scan can be reprocessed by clicking the "Scan Domain" button
      at the center of the bottom row of the commander panel. In case you like the topology
      image, chose the <em>Topology</em> entry in the combo box next to the <em>Scan Topology</em>
      button.
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The XCommander panel</h2>
   <blockquote>
      The main commander window consists of two main areas. The leftmost panel
      allows to navigate  through the cell system if a cell/domain scan has been 
      previously done. Otherwise the navigator windos are empty. A cell 
      system scan can
      be triggered from this panel by pressing the <em>SScan Domain</em> button
      at the center of the bottom row<p>
      The rightmost part of the XCommander is the actual commander window, 
      called the EasyCommander.
      It allows to specify
      the destination cell name and the command text field and presents a scrollable
      text area for the destination cell output text. 
      <p>
      The destination cell name field is automatically filled when a domain/cell
      is selected in the navigation panel.
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The Easy Commander</h2>
   <blockquote>
      The <em>Easy Commander</em> essentially sends a command string to a cell and
      displays the output as soon as it arrives. The command can just be typed into
      the <em>Command</em> text field or may be recalled by typing the <em>back arrow</em>
      key in case the command has been issued previously. 
      The destination cell name can either be typed into the <em>Destination</em> text
      field or may be selected from the navigation panel to the left if a domain scan has
      been issued before. If given manually,
      the cell destination name has to be fully qualified <em>&lt;cell&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;</em>
      if the cell is not a <em>Wellknow
      cell</em> otherwise just the cell name is sufficient. The most recent cell destinations
      may as well be chosen from the destination text field combo box.
      
      For convenience, the EasyCommander issues
      the three  most useful commands by just pressing one of the prepared buttons,
      which is <em>info, pinboard and help</em> for all cells except for the system cell
      where the buttons are doing a <em>processes, routes and help</em>. Because
      Frau Dr. Ressmann
      thought it would be a good idea, we are appending the date/time after each
      cell output into the output display area to separate supsequent outputs.
      We have to admit that she was right, its quite useful.
   </blockquote>
   <h2>The navigation panel</h2>
   <blockquote>    
      In case a cell system scan has been done, the navigation panel contains
      the cell system topology. There are two views into the cell topology.
      <p>
      The <strong>double list view</strong> offers all domains in the upper list. Selecting
      one of the domains lists the cell domain content in the lower list.
      This operation may take awhile if done the first time for this domain.
      Selecting a cell out of the lower list, lets the destination cell 
      text field switch to this cell name. The cell content of a domain is cached locally,
      so that a change in number or names of cells in a domain is not reflected
      automatically within those lists. To get the domain content refreshed,
      select the Domain you want to have updated in the upper list and press
      <em>Update Cells</em> just below the lower cell list.
      <p>
      The <strong>tree view</strong> is chosen by pressing the
      <em>Toggle Views</em> button below the lower cells list while
      the panel is in <strong>double list mode</strong>. Pressing the button again
      will switch back. The <em>tree view</em>
      presents the domains as branches in a tree structure. To view the cells,
      which are obviously the tree leaves, just click on the red circle of the
      corresponding domain/branch.
      The whole tree becomes 'disabled'
      and as soon as the domain content (the cells) are available, the 
      the circle changes to green. Clicking the handle of a branch lets it expand and
      shows the cells of that domain. So, chosing the handle
      of a green button show the cached content while chosing the handle of a red button
      fetches the cell names first which leads to a delay in displaying the cells. 
      <blockquote>
         <font color="gray">
         <strong>Possible misbehaviour : </strong><br>
         In the latter case it eventually
         happens that the tree messes up and comes up with extremly long lines connecting
         the tree branchs. To get rid of that, collapse the branch again by activating 
         the corresponding handle, select the branch name and press the
         <em>Update cells</em> button. Finally click the handle of the branch again.
         </font>
      </blockquote>
      The domains itself and the contents of the domains are not refreshed automatically.
      To get the domain structure refresh, chose the <em>Scan topology</em> button and
      to get the content of a domain (the cells) refreshed, collaps the domain, select the
      domain name and press the <em>Update cells</em> button. Expanding the domain
      will display the udated domain content.
