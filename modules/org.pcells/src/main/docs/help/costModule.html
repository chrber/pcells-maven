<h2>dCache Cost Monitoring Module</h2>
<blockquote>
   In order to find the appropriate pool candidate for each read, write or restore request,
   the PoolManager collects <em>CPU</em> and <em>disk space</em> related cost information
   from all connected pools. Please checkout the documentation area of 
   <strong>www.dCache.ORG</strong> for more information how this is done.
   <p>
   The Cost Module essentially displays the cost information of all the pools.
   <h3>Startup and info collection</h3>
   <blockquote>
      As soon as the cost module starts up, which is as soon as the
      GUI successfully connects to a dCache instance, it collects
      the <em>Pool Group</em> and <em>Link</em> information from the
      dCache <em>PoolManager</em>. A progress bar on the bottom of the
      panel shows the progress. It has to go twice before its done.
      After that the PoolGroup sets and the Links Sets are loaded.
      To get the <em>Cost Information</em> press the <em>Update Cost</em>
      button. Again the same progess bar shows how much is already loaded. 
   </blockquote>
   <h3>Pool Set specific cost picture</h3>
   <blockquote>
    The pool set selection part on the left side of the cost module panel
    allows to select either a set of pools which correspond to a PoolManager
    <em>PoolGroup</em> or to a PoolManager <em>Link</em>. One may switch between
    those views using the <em>Toggle Source</em> buttom below the
    list component on the left side of the panel.
    The cost histogram on the right side of the panel only shows those pools
    which belong to the set selected on the left side.
   </blockquote>
   <h3>The cost picture</h3>
   <blockquote>
     The cost picture itself can be viewed in three modes. Those modes are selected
     by the combo box on the right bottom side of the panel.
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Sorted by Space Cost</strong> The cost is still split into
       space and cpu cost as received from the pools. The upper part is the
       space and the lower part (below the zero line) is the cpu cost.
       The display is <em>sorted by space cost</em>. So the upper part of the display
       monotonoly grows from left to right. The cpu cost below the zero line
       usually looks rather fuzzy.
       <li><strong>Sorted by CPU Cost</strong> The cost is still split into
       space and cpu cost as received from the pools. The upper part is the
       space and the lower part (below the zero line) is the cpu cost.
       The dispay is sorted by cpu cost. So the lower part of the display
       monotonoly grows from left to right. The space cost above the zero line
       usually looks rather fuzzy.
       <li><strong>Sorted by merged CPU and Space cost</strong>. The space and cpu
       cost info received fromt the PoolManager is merged according to the
       <em>pool decision cost factores</em>. Those numbers are shown on the left side just
       below the cost image. They may be changed in the panel. This re-adjusts the
       image accordingly. The actual value in dCache is not affected.
     </ul>
     Each vertical line in the cost picture represents a pool. To get the name
     of a particular line, click into the image. One of the lines is not green but
     red. The name of the corresponding pool is shown just above the middle line
     of the image on the left side. Use the left/right arrow keys to move the
     red line (pool names) to the desired destination.
