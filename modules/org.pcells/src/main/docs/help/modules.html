<h2>pCell plug-in Modules</h2>
<blockquote>
   The pCell GUI itself is just a framework mainly providing secure login into a cell system. 
   The actual work is done by plug-in modules
   designed for special purposes. This distribution is coming with a predefined set
   of modules. More modules might be added by users. Checkout the chapter
   <em>Adding your own plug-in modules</em> for further details.
   Subsequently we briefly discuss the default modules. Inspect the 
   corresponding chapters for a detailed discussion.
   <ul type="i">
    <li><strong>XCommander</strong> dCache independend module to 
        communication with an arbitrary cell. Allows to scan the cell system
        and detects all available cells.
    <li><strong>Restore and Transfer queues</strong>. Those modules provide two
        views into the restore and the transfer queue respectively. A graphical histogram
        and a table of all entries. Many actions can be performed on the table entries, like
        retry and cancel. The histograms allow autoupdate and may be detached from the
        GUI application and independently placed somewhere on your screen.
    <li><strong>Pools</strong>. The pools module allows to perform commands on a
         defined set of pools simultaniously. The result is presented in a table.
         Sets of pools may be taken from the PoolManager pool grouping or 
         may be contructed into a temporary user specific pool group.
    <li><strong>Cost Module</strong>. The cost module allows to get an impression on the
         cost of all active pools. It distingues between 'cpu', 'space' and total costs.
   </ul>
