<h2>Restore and Transfer Queues (Commonalities)</h2>
<blockquote>
Beside all the fancy stuff, dCache essentially handles data transfers. Depending on
the type of transfer and the load of the system, those transfers may
take a certain time or may even be scheduled only, but not yet processed because
of a lack of resources, which can be CPU, space etc. 
The current design of dCache 
doesn't handle those transfer queues centrally. The central dCache components
delegate all those transfers immediatly to the most appropriate pool.
dCache essentially handles the following queue types :
<ol type="a">
  <li>Transfers between dCache pools and client applications. (dCap,ftp,http...)</strong>
  <li>Transfers from HSM systems into a dCache pool</strong>
  <li>Transfers from dCache pools into HSM systems</strong>.
  <li>Transfers between pools.
</ol>
To make those highly distributed queues managable, dCache builds <em>virtual
queues</em> which are consequently the sum of the queues of same type from the
corresponding pools. Right now, those different queue types are handled slightly
different. Queue <strong>c</strong> has no central virtual queue yet,
they are treated totally autonomous by the corresponding pools. 
Queue <strong>b</strong> and <strong>d</strong> are managed by the same
component, the <em>PoolManager</em>. The PoolManager sends the incoming requests to
the appropriate pools and monitors the transfer process. At any time, it has a valid list of 
all its subqueues. Virtual queue <strong>b</strong> is constructed by
a component which frequently scans the pools and creates a list of 
all transfers of that type. This process may take awhile and is started 
within configurable intervals. Consequently this queue is always slightly
out of date. <p>
This GUI allows to inspect and manipulate the <strong>b/d</strong> as well as the 
<strong>a</strong> queue type by different modules, namely <strong>Restore</strong> and
<strong>Transfer</strong> respectively. Although the general outlook and behaviour of
the two modules look simaliar, there are important differences in operation.
While the common part is described here, the differences are 
handles in the subsequent chapters (<strong>Restore</strong> and <strong>Tansfers</strong>)
<h3>Queue views</h3>
   <blockquote>
     The queue modules present the corresponding queue in two ways. In
     <em>List Mode</em> the queue is listed in table form. The table can be sorted
     by column in increasing and descreasing order. Various operations can be
     performed on list entries as well as on selection of list entries.
     In <em>Histogram Mode</em> the queue is represented in a time series histogram.
     This histogram can be automatically updated and may be detached from the
     main application for continues monitoring.
   </blockquote>
<h3>List Mode Details</h3>
   <blockquote>
   In <em>List Mode</em> all queue entries are represented in a table. The table my be
   sorted according to the content of any column. 
   Clicking on a header resp. title field of a column will sort all
   rows according that column in ascending order. Clicking a second time, does the sorting
   in descending order.<p>
   The width of the different columns are all identical on startup which only in rare cases
   fits the needs. By moving the
   small bars between the title fields of the columns, its width can be custumized.
   <p> 
   Actions can be performed on selections of rows. How the selection is created depends
   on the underlying window system. In general, just clicking on a row, selects exactly
   this row. To select a continues set of rows one need to click on the top row and,
   pressing the shift key clicking the bottom row. Arbitrary rows may be added resp. removed to/from
   a selection by holding the CONTROL key while clicking the corresponding row.
